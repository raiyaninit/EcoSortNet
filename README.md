# ðŸŒ¿ Waste Classification Using CNN

---

### Problem Statement

India generates millions of tons of waste every year, and improper disposal remains a major challenge. Organic waste (such as food scraps and garden material) and inorganic waste (such as plastics, metals, and glass) are often mixed together, leading to:

- Rapidly filling landfills  
- Pollution of soil, water, and air  
- Health hazards for humans and animals  

Currently, a large portion of waste management in India relies on manual segregation, which is time-consuming, inefficient, and often unsafe. With the growing population and urbanization, automating waste classification has become essential.

### Project Overview

Through this project, I aim to build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model capable of classifying waste images into **Organic** and **Recyclable** categories.  
The goal is to develop a system that can provide quick, reliable predictions to assist in better waste segregation.

This project explores how machine learning can support cleaner and more sustainable waste management practices by improving efficiency and reducing human involvement in hazardous processes.
